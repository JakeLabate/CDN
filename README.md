# Jake Labate's CDN
Just a little collection of tools by/for me (and whoever wants to contribute to/use them). My primary website is [www.jakelabate.com](https://www.jakelabate.com?utm_source=My%CDN). Visit my site's [/code](https://www.jakelabate.com/code?utm_source=My%CDN) URL to see all of my code resources.
## [Custom Link Cursors](https://github.com/JakeLabate/CDN/tree/master/custom-link-cursors)
Impliment custom cursors based on each specific link. This includes social media icon cursors, cursors to indicate link location (#section, internal, external, email etc) background color detectection, and cursor size control.
## [Link Favicons as Cursors](https://github.com/JakeLabate/CDN/tree/master/link-favicons-as-cursors)
Set the mouse cursor to the favicons of the link website destination. This searches for the /favicon.icon path, then tries Google's favicon API, then falls back to a 'pointer' cursor.
## [Auto Add Schema Markup](https://github.com/JakeLabate/CDN/tree/master/auto-add-schema-markup)
Auto-generate and embed schema.org markup JSONs. Markup is templated, and triggered based on identifing specific semantic HTML tags, and page metadata.
